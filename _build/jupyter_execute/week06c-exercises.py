# ### Python modules
# 
# a. Write two more unit conversion functions (converting one way and back). 
# 
# b. Use one in the `if __name__ == '__main__':`  section of convert.py
# 
# c. Use the other in myscript.py
# 
# d. Run these files from the shell, and see what parts of the code are run 
#     
# e. Think about what other functions would be useful in your research (conversion or otherwise). If time, try to implement one or more of these functions in a module.
