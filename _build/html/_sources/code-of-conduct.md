### Code of conduct

All possible efforts will be made to ensure that this class is welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. However, some groups in our community are subject to historical and ongoing discrimination, and may be vulnerable or disadvantaged. Membership in such a specific group can be on the basis of characteristics such as such as gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality, sex, color, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, citizenship, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, age, or choice of operating system. Harassment of participants on the basis of these categories, or for any other reason, will not be tolerated.

Harassment is any form of behavior intended to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort. Because we are a diverse community, we may have different ways of communicating and of understanding the intent behind actions. Therefore, certain forms of behavior are prohibited, regardless of intent. Prohibited harassing behavior includes but is not limited to:

*	written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of a specific group listed above;
*	the display of sexual or violent images;
*	unwelcome sexual attention;
*	comments that are sexual in nature;
*	non-consensual or unwelcome physical contact;
*	sustained disruption of class; and
*	publication of private information without consent.

Behavior not explicitly mentioned above may still constitute harassment. The list above should not be taken as exhaustive but rather as a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the communities in which we participate. All interactions should be professional regardless of location: harassment is prohibited whether it occurs on or offline, and the same standards apply to both.

Enforcement of the Code of Conduct will be respectful and not include any harassing behaviors.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.
